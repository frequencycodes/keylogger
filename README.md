# keylogger

Our task is to write a python script that saves all the keys pressed by the user in a text file.

Hint: pynput is a library in python that is used to control the keyboard and mouse movement and it can also be used in making a keylogger. Simply reads the keys pressed by the user and after a certain amount of keys saves them in a text file.
